# StunningHelper
This mod is exclusively designed to allow setting offset values for spinners. It should only be used if you plan on including stunning as an intended mechanic; if you want to make a situation unstunnable, there are other mods for that. 

This mod adds 3 entities: CustomOffsetSpinner, CustomOffsetDustBunny, and CustomOffsetLightning. Each of them are the same as their vanilla counterparts, except for the ability to set offset (or in lightning's case, toggleOffset). 

This mod also adds 1 trigger: Set TimeActive Trigger. It allows you to set timeactive when the player enters, stays, or leaves, depending on the toggle. I'm not sure which option will be the best for making a setup, but I suspect it would be enter.

If you do make a mod with stunning as an intended mechanic, please let me know. I won't play it, but I'd love to hear about it.
