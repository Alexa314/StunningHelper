# StunningHelper
This mod is exclusively designed to allow setting offset values for spinners. It should only be used if you plan on including stunning as an intended mechanic; if you want to make a situation unstunnable, there are other mods for that. 

This mod adds 3 entities: CustomOffsetSpinner, CustomOffsetDustBunny, and CustomOffsetLightning. Each of them are the same as their vanilla counterparts, except for the ability to set offset (or in lightning's case, toggleOffset). 

If you do make a mod with stunning as an intended mechanic, please let me know. I won't play it, but I'd love to hear about it.
